Java Development Internship - OASIS INFOBYTE
Welcome to Oasis Infobyte Java Development Projects repository. 
This repository contains Java projects, including "Online Examination System, Number Guessing Game and ATM Interface ." 
These projects are designed to help you improve your Java programming skills and showcase your knowledge.

Project 2: Number Guessing Game
The second project I worked on was a number-guessing game.
While this project was relatively simple, it helped me develop my logic and problem-solving skills. I
was able to implement features such as limiting the number of attempts, adding more rounds, and displaying a score based on the number of attempts. 
This project also helped me improve my understanding of Java programming concepts such as loops, conditional statements, and object-oriented programming.
